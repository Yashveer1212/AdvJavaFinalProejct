Title: Expense Manager 
Date: May 26, 2023
Description: This is my 2023 final for my high school Advanced Java class. We were tasked with building an app with all the knowledge we had leanred this year from regex to testing. I created a app that allows people to
track thier finaces on a proper level. This app allows users to track their expenses and income, view their financial history, and manage their budgets. The user interface is designed using HTML/CSS, and the app utilizes an SQLite database to store and retrieve user data. The app also includes unit tests to ensure the functionality of the different features and RegEx to validate user inputs.
